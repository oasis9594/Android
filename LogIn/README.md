#**Log In Application**
This app maintains a local database using SQLite database to save user's login information. 
Further shared preferences file stores information that user is logged in or not and stores it's details.
There's a sign up page where user can register himself. After registering, user can enter his details and log in.
This will open up a new activity where user is shown his details like name and username. 
User can also change his password.
